 QUICK START
 -----------

 This readme serves as a quick start, please use `man jdoo' for
 documentation on the program.

 Installation:
 -------------

   -  ./configure
   -  make
   -  make install
   -  man jdoo

 This will install jdoo and the man-file in /usr/local/bin and
 /usr/local/man/man1 respectively. If you want another location than
 /usr/local, run configure with the prefix options, like so:
 ./configure --prefix=<dir>

 Notes:
 ------

 - This directory contains an example jdoo control file, called
   jdoorc. Please read it and use it as a starting point when you
   write your own jdoo control file.

 - jdoo will probably work on most Unix systems. However, jdoo is
   tested and known to compile and operate on: Darwin, Linux, FreeBSD,
   NetBSD, OpenBSD and Solaris.
